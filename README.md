# TamaTownServerSideScripts
Recreation's of the server-side code for TamaTown

NOTE: This is NOT bandai's original code. it wouldnt really be possible to get that unless someone had an exploit back in the day to get the files out, rather- this is my best attempts to re-create what the server side code did
the login/logout password functionality is missing because no one knows how it works. its a known issue that cannot be fixed unless you dump the ROM of the actural tamagotchi and reverse how it works.

this is the same code used on my personal Familetchi server (http://famita.ml)
