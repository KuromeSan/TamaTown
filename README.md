# TamaTown
What is this?

A set of tools for setting up your own TamaTown server, originally hosted by Bandai.

--- Server Side Code ---

NOTE: This is NOT bandai's original code. it wouldnt really be possible to get that unless someone had an exploit back in the day to get the files out, rather- this is my best attempts to re-create what the server side code did.

this is the same code used on my Familetchi server (http://famita.ml) - the "ORIGINAL" xD


Working so far:
